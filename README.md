The Game of War:

War is a classic card game typically played between 2 players. Disclaimer: this game is all luck, no strategy. The deck is shuffled and dealt so that each player starts with 26 cards in their hand. Players keep their cards facing down in a stack. From here, the game becomes a sequence of rounds in which each player draws the 4 cards at the top of their hand, only flipping over the fourth card in the middle of the table. The player with the highest scoring card keeps their 4 cards and gains their opponent's 4 cards, adding them to the bottom of their hand. If the cards are of matching values, players set aside the 4 cards from that round and proceed to a tiebreaker round (same procedures as a normal round) and the winner takes all the cards from both rounds. The first player to run out of cards loses!

Getting Started:

Click on the Shuffle & Deal button to get things set up to start playing. Then click the Draw button each time you are ready to start the next round. In case of a tie, the Draw button will be replaced by the Break Tie button. At the end of each game, the winner will be announced at the top of the screen and you will have the option to reset and play again.

Next Steps:

In future versions of this game, I plan to display the other 3 cards players draw in a round. They will initially be shown facing down, and then they'll be flipped over once the winner of the round is determined. I also want to add a feature that keeps track of player and computer wins across the course of multiple games.
